  "about": "An educator for 40 years, as professor and former chair of Systems Design Engineering and as professor and founding director of the Department of Knowledge Integration at the University of Waterloo, I joined Waterloo in 1976 after completing BS, MS and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering at MIT . My interests include perception in the broadest sense, in particular vision and image processing, pattern recognition, non-linear and adaptive systems, and knowledge integration an design. I have developed and taught courses in linear systems and signals, pattern recognition, and image processing at both undergraduate and graduate levels in Systems Design Engineering. Beginning in 2008 I reinvented myself as a teacher, developing and teaching courses in design thinking and real world problem solving for Knowledge Integration. I have been recognized with the Distinguished Teacher Award of the University of Waterloo and the Teaching Excellence Award for the Faculty of Engineering. My involvement with high school enrichment began as Program Director for the SHAD summer enrichment program, 1984-2015. I began building Waterloo Unlimited, a university wide enrichment program for exceptional high school students, in 2004. I see Waterloo's new Knowledge Integration (BKI) program, started in 2008, as the culmination of 35 years of education by design, providing an alternative to narrowly specialized undergraduate programs for students who want a framework for knowing their world and the skills to make a difference that transcends disciplines--who want to be problem solvers and change makers without boundaries. I retired in August 2016, and continue to be engaged in outreach, occasional teaching, and work on a new course to develop deep numeracy, or quantitative thinking around models of patterns in time, patterns in space, and patterns in data. Also grandsons, travel, and life on the Nith River in rural Ontario...",
